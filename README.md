# VAE-GNA: Variational Autoencoder using Gaussian Neurons and Attention Layer

# ===== THIS REPO IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION =====


## Supplementary Code for My Master's Dissertation

This repository contains the code developed for my master's dissertation. Below are the instructions on how to use it. If you find any bugs or have any observations, please let me know. Don't hesitate to get in touch with me.

## Dependencies

The code is developed in a Python environment, specifically using Jupyter Notebook. The deep learning models are implemented using PyTorch and Scikit-Learn.

To install all dependencies, ensure you have Python set up on your Linux/Windows machine, then run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
